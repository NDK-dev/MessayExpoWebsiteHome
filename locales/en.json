Traditional eye-tracking required expensive equipment, but by 2050, it will be available on any device with a built-in camera. Eye control may become as natural as using hands or voice, not only as a communication tool for those with mobility impairments but also in everyday life. This exhibit features a "Eye Control Shopping" offering a glimpse into a future where eye control is an everyday convenience."
